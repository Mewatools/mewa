# What is Mewa

Mewa is a framework used to create software solutions dedicated to simplifying the chaotic world of motion graphics for artists.

## Vector based Animations

With CSS dn SVG animations becoming more common through websites and mobile apps, the need for smoother and richer animations keeps growing.

Mewa was designed from the ground up to raise the bar of web animations performance. Taking full advantage of GPU, Mewa can deliver smoother animations, with an even richer content.

It's main goal is to make cross-platform animations feel faster and responsive, running richer animations on any screen size and aspect ratio.

Mewa Animations offer:
- Constant frame rate: for guaranteed smooth animations
- Offload work from CPU to GPU : for responsive user interaction
- Scale-invariant drawing : for seamless look & feel across any screen size
- Small file size : for faster startup
- javascript API : for programmable user interaction (something XML and JSON do not)
- Portable across mobile, desktop and web

## Video compositing

With an underlying node-graph interface, Mewa aims to offer compositing capabilities with:

- Faster/Imediate previews, everywhere
- Previews in full resolution, always
- More intuitive user interface
- Dedicated script engine for:
  - Faster execution of expressions/scripts
  - Guaranteed UI responsiveness
  - Easier extensibility and customizability

## Mewa Framework

Mewa framework is a C++ OpenGL based UI framework designed from ground-up to deliver higher performance applications across desktop and mobile devices.

It holds a whole collection of reusable classes on which the Mewa application is built on.
